# UM-Rose starter guide

This is based on the document originally produced by Phil Rosenberg, so thanks to him. Some information may be out of date, though - we should try to check and update this.

For some alternative instructions on some of these things and more trouble-shooting advice, also see this page :- [[UM_common_issues]]

Monsoon


Monsoon is the met Office supercomputer accessible by their collaborators. This document describes my experience of going from no idea to (sometimes) getting the UM to run on Monsoon using the Rose interface.

You will need 3 accounts to use Monsoon. The first is a Monsoon account (obviously). The second is a Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSRS) account which allows you access to the UM source code. The third is a Collab Twiki account, which will give you access to the (slightly scattered) documentation.
