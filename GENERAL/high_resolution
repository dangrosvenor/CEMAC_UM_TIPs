# High Resolution Specific Notes

The Regional Area Science settings e.g. [RA2](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/ra2) are scale aware.

For sub-km simulations the RMED team have a useful [wiki page](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/subkm) of settings (time steps etc) and adjustments that may be needed.

# Troubleshooting

# Ancillary generation issues

## VEGFRAC failing

Generating subkm vegfrac ancillaries might fail in their interpolating. Its unclear why this is but you can
use the fields from the parent nest where necessary. A neat way of doing this is to create exp1 config for
your failing nest.


 I’d just set the soil necessary ancillaries to `source=1` (allow recon to decide) for the failing nest's reconfiguration.
 This will then mean it picks up the parent nest ancillary data, which is more than good
 enough given the errors/approximations in the source data.

Assuming you are using the same science configuration for all resolutions you can copy
to that configuration to the expt1. i.e. copy `app/um/opt/rose-app-ra2t.conf` (or whatever config you’re using)
to `app/um/opt/rose-app-expt1.conf` .

Then add the ancil code from the `app/um/rose-app.conf` to the end of `expt1.conf` file,
 so for the latest version of the suite this is

```
[namelist:items(4c515841)]
ancilfilename='$UM_ANCIL_VEGFRAC_DIR/$UM_ANCIL_VEGFRAC_FILE'
domain=1
!!interval=1
l_ignore_ancil_grid_check=.true.
!!netcdf_varname='unset'
!!period=1
source=1
stash_req=216
update_anc=.false.
!!user_prog_ancil_stash_req=
!!user_prog_rconst=0.0

[namelist:items(884a098e)]
ancilfilename='$UM_ANCIL_SOIL_DIR/$UM_ANCIL_SOIL_FILE'
domain=1
!!interval=1
l_ignore_ancil_grid_check=.false.
!!netcdf_varname=10*'unset'
!!period=1
source=1
stash_req=40,41,43,44,46,47,48,207,220,223
update_anc=.false.
!!user_prog_ancil_stash_req=
!!user_prog_rconst=0.0
```

**NB `source=2` is edited to `source=1`**

Then in the affected resolution configuration window make sure your change the `ra2t` or whatever
in the drop down menu to `expt1`.

# Domain Size

At high Resolution you may find your domain size is larger than the max sizes check for in Defensive checks

You will need to checkout a copy of the source code and edit

`src/control/misc/atmos_max_sizes.F90`

*NB check the source you're checking out matches you might need a branch of a branch!*

Rebuild your executables and a larger domain will now be allowed
